/// Description:
///
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///
/// It is file containing source code of genetic algorithm to solve
/// multi-knapsack problem. It turned out that the genetic algorithm
/// very well solves the multi-backpack problem.
///
/// The file is share on the open source licence, but unlike GPL, MIT, BSD
/// APACHE, L-GPL, etc,  it is NOT standard and NOT liberary licence of the
/// open source. By downloading and reading this file, you conclude a contract
/// with me. Namely, if you understand that my source code can be improved
/// (for example: speed up, better algorithms, better parametrs,  fixed
/// bugs, etc), you need to present me everything in very detail. You
/// can only download, read and compile this project only on the your
/// personal computer. You can run the executable file and solve
/// education or example problem, but only on the your own personal
/// computer. You can see what the genetic alghoritm work in any
/// practical multi-knapsack problem. However you can not use result
/// this project in the  business applications. You also can NOT modifi,
/// reshare, redistribuate binary or text version this or other file from
/// whole project.  You can not use whole file or fews lines from the file
/// in your or others projects.
